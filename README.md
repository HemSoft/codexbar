# CodexBar 🎚️ for Windows

A Windows system tray app that keeps your AI provider usage limits visible. Inspired by [steipete/CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) (macOS).

Built with Rust, [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/) and [gpui-kit](https://gpui-kit.com/): native Windows, no Electron overhead.

## Providers

| Provider | Auth Method | What's Tracked |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **ChatGPT / Codex** | Codex CLI ChatGPT login (`~/.codex/auth.json`), or browser sign-in per account through the Codex CLI | 5-hour + weekly usage limits |
| **Claude** | Claude Code login (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`), or a separate sign-in per account through Claude Code | Session + weekly limits, extra-usage spend |
| **Copilot** | GitHub CLI (`gh auth`), or browser sign-in per account through the GitHub CLI | Usage limits per account; organization AI credits for Enterprise seats |
| **Cursor** | Cursor app sign-in (`%APPDATA%\Cursor\auth.json`), or browser sign-in per account through the Cursor CLI | Plan usage and spend |
| **OpenCode Go / Zen** | Dashboard cookie + workspace ID | Usage and balance |
| **OpenRouter** | API Key | Credits, usage across models |
| **Moonshot (Kimi)** | API Key | Remaining API credit balance |

## Features

- **System tray** icon with a usage tooltip
- **Dashboard** with an account table, focus cards, usage history and window curves
- **Alerts** when an account nears or hits its limit
- **Groups and ordering** by urgency or by hand
- **System, light and dark appearance**, following Windows high contrast
- **Privacy-first**: on-device only, no data sent anywhere except provider APIs; keys are kept in Windows Credential Manager

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (the MSVC toolchain; `rust-toolchain.toml` pins stable)
- Visual Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
- Node.js 20 or later (required for `npm install` / pre-commit hook setup)

### Build from source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar.git
cd codexbar
npm install          # Also configures the pre-commit hook
.\run.ps1            # Builds in release and starts CodexBar in the system tray
```

`run.ps1` copies the app to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexBar\bin\codexbar.exe` and replaces a running instance. For
development, `cargo run -p codexbar-app -- --demo` starts the dashboard with sample data beside the real app.

### Provider setup

1. **ChatGPT / Codex**: Run `codex` and sign in with your ChatGPT account. For more accounts, add a Codex account with the OAuth sign-in method in Settings > Accounts; CodexBar signs it in with your browser through the Codex CLI
2. **Claude**: Run `claude` and sign in. For more accounts, add a Claude account with the Browser session method in Settings > Accounts; CodexBar opens a Claude Code window to sign it in
3. **Copilot**: Uses GitHub CLI tokens — run `gh auth login` for each account, or add a Copilot account with the OAuth sign-in method and sign it in from Settings. For an Enterprise seat, set the account's enterprise and organization (and optionally the pool total) to see the organization's AI credits
4. **Cursor**: Sign in to the Cursor app. For more accounts, install the Cursor CLI (`cursor-agent`) and add a Cursor account with the OAuth sign-in method in Settings > Accounts
5. **OpenRouter**: Get an API key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and add it in Settings, or set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
6. **Moonshot (Kimi)**: Get an API key from [platform.kimi.ai](https://platform.kimi.ai/) and add it in Settings, or set `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`
7. **OpenCode Go / Zen**: Sign in at [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai), then add an OpenCode Go account in Settings with the dashboard auth cookie and your workspace id (`wrk_…`), or set `OPENCODE_GO_AUTH_COOKIE` and `OPENCODE_GO_WORKSPACE_ID`. OpenCode Zen uses the same cookie unless you give it its own (`OPENCODE_ZEN_AUTH_COOKIE`)

How each sign-in works, and what CodexBar stores and sends, is in [docs/OAUTH.md](docs/OAUTH.md) and [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).

## Installing, updating and support

There is no packaged release yet: CodexBar is built from source with `run.ps1`
(see [Build from source](#build-from-source)). A signed MSIX package with
updates is planned for the first release
([#93](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/93)).

- **Update**: `git pull`, then `.\run.ps1`. It rebuilds, stops the running
  CodexBar and starts the new one. Settings, saved keys and history are kept.
- **Roll back**: check out an earlier commit (`git checkout <commit>`) and run
  `.\run.ps1` again. Settings stay compatible: a file from a newer CodexBar is
  opened read-only rather than overwritten.
- **Start with Windows**: `run.ps1` keeps an existing `CodexBar` entry in
  `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` pointed at the installed
  app.
- **Widgets**: Windows widgets need a packaged app, so they come with the MSIX
  release ([#94](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/94),
  [#95](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/95)).
- **Uninstall**: delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexBar\bin`, the `.codexbar` folder in
  your profile, and the `CodexBar:account:*` entries in Credential Manager.
- **Support**: report problems at
  [github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues).
  Never paste keys, tokens or cookies into an issue.

Differences from the iOS app are listed in
[docs/IOS_DIFFERENCES.md](docs/IOS_DIFFERENCES.md).

## Architecture

```text
Cargo.toml
├── crates/codexbar-core/       # Models, metrics, alerts, layout, formatting
├── crates/codexbar-providers/  # One module per provider, HTTP and OAuth helpers
├── crates/codexbar-store/      # Settings, credentials, snapshots, usage history

```

The `src/` folder holds the retired C# / WPF app.
