# Privacy and data handling

CodexBar runs on your PC only. It has no server, no account of its own, no
analytics and no telemetry. It talks to each provider's own API, with the
sign-in or key you gave it, and to nothing else.

## Network destinations

CodexBar sends requests only to providers that are on and have a sign-in or key
to use. On a first start, before any account is set up, every provider except
Moonshot is on: one already signed in on this PC (the Codex CLI, Claude Code, the
Cursor app, the GitHub CLI) is fetched right away, and one without a sign-in or
key makes no request. Switch a provider off in Settings > Accounts to stop it.

| Provider | Endpoint | Authenticated with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ChatGPT / Codex | `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` | The Codex sign-in (`auth.json`) |
| Claude | `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` | The Claude Code sign-in (`.credentials.json`) |
| Copilot | `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/user`, and for org billing `https://api.github.com/enterprises/…/settings/billing/ai_credit/usage` and `https://api.github.com/orgs/…/copilot/billing` | A GitHub CLI token |
| Cursor | `https://api2.cursor.sh/aiserver.v1.DashboardService/GetCurrentPeriodUsage` | The Cursor sign-in (`auth.json`) |
| OpenRouter | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/credits` | Your API key |
| Moonshot (Kimi) | `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1/users/me/balance` | Your API key |
| OpenCode Go / Zen | `https://opencode.ai/workspace/…` | Your dashboard auth cookie |

Signing an account in from Settings runs the provider's own CLI (Codex CLI,
GitHub CLI, Claude Code or the Cursor CLI), which talks to that provider's
sign-in service. CodexBar opens the provider's sign-in page in your default
browser. See [OAUTH.md](OAUTH.md) for how each sign-in works.

## Secrets

- **API keys and cookies** you paste in Settings are stored in Windows
  Credential Manager under `CodexBar:account:<id>`, never in a file. An
  environment variable (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, …) takes
  precedence over a stored key. Keys an older CodexBar left in its settings
  file are moved to Credential Manager at startup.
- **Copilot accounts CodexBar signs in** keep their GitHub CLI token in
  Credential Manager, split across parts when it is long.
- **Codex, Claude and Cursor accounts CodexBar signs in** keep their sign-in
  where the provider's CLI writes it, in that account's own folder under the
  settings folder (`codex\`, `claude\`, `cursor\`). CodexBar reads those files
  and never writes them.
- **Sign-ins of the providers' own apps** (`~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, the Cursor
  app's, your `gh` accounts) are only read.
- Secrets never appear in the UI, error messages, notifications, logs or
  saved snapshots. Errors keep only a provider's short error text or status.

## Files

Everything CodexBar writes lives in `%USERPROFILE%\.codexbar`. With
`CODEXBAR_SETTINGS_DIR` set (for isolated testing), everything except
`history.jsonl` moves to that folder:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.json` | Accounts (provider, name, sign-in method, username or workspace id, org billing settings), refresh interval, zoom |
| `dashboard.json` | Groups, order, appearance, alert settings, which alerts were shown, hidden history series |
| `snapshots.json` | The last good usage of each account (ids, labels, metric names, numbers, times), so the dashboard shows something at startup and while a provider fails |
| `history.jsonl` | Usage samples for the history charts, kept **30 days** and pruned at startup |
| `codex\`, `claude\`, `cursor\` | One folder per account CodexBar signed in, holding that provider CLI's own sign-in files |

Removing an account in Settings deletes its saved key or token, its folder and
its usage history (for accounts that are their own dashboard account). Reset
accounts does the same for every account. Removing the `.codexbar` folder
removes everything else CodexBar stored.

## Notifications

Alerts (nearing or hitting a limit) are shown as Windows notifications. They
contain the account's name and the alert, never a secret.
