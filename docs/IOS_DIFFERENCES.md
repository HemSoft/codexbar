# Differences from codexbar-ios

CodexBar for Windows follows [codexbar-ios](https://github.com/HemSoft/codexbar-ios)
(compared with its README at commit `e117c41`, October 5, 2026). These are the
differences that remain, and why.

## Providers

| Provider | iOS | Windows | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ChatGPT / Codex, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, OpenRouter, OpenCode Go + Zen, Moonshot | Yes | Yes | |
| GitHub Billing (separate accounts) | Yes | No | [#104](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/104), [#105](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/105) await provider decisions |
| Greptile | Yes | No | [#103](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/103) |
| Grok | Yes | No | [#108](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/108) |
| Google Gemini | Yes | No | [#106](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/106), [#107](https://github.com/hemsoft-dev/codexbar/issues/107) |

Copilot organization billing on Windows covers Copilot Enterprise seats:
the organization's AI credits and each user's share, configured per account.

## Signing in

- **iOS** signs accounts in itself, in the app (browser or private sign-in),
  and for Copilot ships the public client ID used by Copilot CLI-compatible
  clients.
- **Windows** uses no borrowed client IDs. Extra accounts are signed in through
  each provider's own CLI, each in a folder of its own: the Codex CLI's
  app-server, the GitHub CLI's device sign-in, a Claude Code window, and the
  Cursor CLI. The CLIs' own sign-ins (`~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, `gh`, the Cursor
  app) are the fallback. See [OAUTH.md](OAUTH.md).
- Secrets live in the iOS Keychain on iOS and in Windows Credential Manager on
  Windows. CLI sign-ins stay in the files those CLIs write.
