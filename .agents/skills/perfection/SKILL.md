            If a file was read, written, or edited in the perfection directory (path contains 'perfection'), verify that history logging occurred.

            Check if History/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md exists and contains an entry for this interaction with:
            - Format: "## HH:MM - {Action Taken}"
            - One-line summary
            - Accurate timestamp (obtained via `Get-Date -Format "HH:mm"` command, never guessed)

            If history entry is missing or incomplete, provide specific feedback on what needs to be added.
            If history entry exists and is properly formatted, acknowledge completion.

            Before stopping, if perfection was used (check if any files in perfection directory were modified), verify that the interaction was logged:

            1. Check if History/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md exists in perfection directory
            2. Verify it contains an entry with format "## HH:MM - {Action Taken}" where HH:MM was obtained via `Get-Date -Format "HH:mm"` (never guessed)
            3. Ensure the entry includes a one-line summary of what was done

            If history entry is missing:
            - Return {"decision": "block", "reason": "History entry missing. Please log this interaction to History/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md with format: ## HH:MM - {Action Taken}\n{One-line summary}\n\nCRITICAL: Get the current time using `Get-Date -Format \"HH:mm\"` command - never guess the timestamp."}

            If history entry exists:
            - Return {"decision": "approve"}

            Include a systemMessage with details about the history entry status.

# Perfection — Total Quality Gate Audit

Drive every quality metric in this repository to its maximum possible score.
When invoked, systematically run all quality gates and fix every finding.

## Perfection Targets

| Gate | Command | Target | What It Measures |
|------|---------|--------|------------------|
| **Build** | `dotnet build` | 0 warnings | Compilation health |
| **Code Format** | `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` | 0 violations | Whitespace, indentation, style |
| **Test Coverage (Line)** | `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` | 100% | Lines exercised by tests |
| **Test Coverage (Branch)** | `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` | 100% | Branches exercised by tests |
| **CRAP Score** | ReportGenerator JSON analysis | 0 methods > 30, avg ≤ 4.0 | Change Risk Anti-Patterns |
| **Security Audit** | `dotnet list package --vulnerable` | 0 vulnerabilities | Known CVEs in dependencies |
| **Markdown Lint** | `markdownlint "**/*.md"` | 0 errors | Documentation quality |

## Commands

### `perfection audit`

Default command. Run all quality gates and produce a consolidated report.

**Steps:**

1. Run each gate in this order (fail-fast: NO — run all, report all):

   ```powershell
   dotnet build                    # Build with zero warnings
   dotnet format --verify-no-changes  # Formatting
   dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings src/CodexBar.Core.Tests/coverage.runsettings  # Tests + coverage
   dotnet list package --vulnerable   # Security audit
   ```

2. For CRAP scores, after test coverage completes:
   - Run ReportGenerator with JSON output and file filters to exclude generated code:

     ```powershell
     reportgenerator -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:CoverageReport -reporttypes:JsonSummary -filefilters:"-**/*.g.cs;-**/GeneratedRegex*.cs"
     ```

   - Flag any method with CRAP > 30
   - **Exclude** source-generated regex methods (see "Generated Code Exclusions" below)
   - Report average CRAP score

3. Present consolidated report:

   ```markdown
   ## Perfection Audit — CodexBar

   | Gate | Status | Detail |
   |------|--------|--------|
   | Build | ✅ / ❌ | 0 warnings / N warnings |
   | Format | ✅ / ❌ | Clean / N violations |
   | Test Coverage (Line) | ✅ / ❌ | 100% / X% |
   | Test Coverage (Branch) | ✅ / ❌ | 100% / Y% |
   | CRAP Score | ✅ / ❌ | All < 30 / N methods ≥ 30 |
   | Security Audit | ✅ / ❌ | 0 vulns / N found |
   | Markdown Lint | ✅ / ❌ | Clean / N errors |

   **Perfection Score: X/7 gates passing**
   ```

### `perfection fix`

Automatically fix as many failing gates as possible in priority order.

**Priority order** (most impactful first):

1. **Build warnings** — fix root causes, never suppress
2. **Format violations** — run `dotnet format` (auto-fix)
3. **Security vulnerabilities** — update packages
4. **Test coverage gaps** — write tests for uncovered code
5. **CRAP score** — refactor complex functions + add tests
6. **Markdown lint** — fix lint errors

**For each gate:**

1. Run the check
2. If failing: apply fixes
3. Re-run to verify the fix worked
4. Move to next gate
5. After all gates: re-run full `perfection audit` to confirm

**Rules:**

- Never skip a failing gate — attempt every fix
- After each fix, re-run that specific gate to verify
- If a fix introduces failures in other gates, roll back and try a different approach
- Commit fixes in logical batches (one commit per gate, not one giant commit)

### `perfection status`

Quick one-liner status of all gates without running them. Reads from the most
recent audit results if available, otherwise runs a fresh audit.

## Integration with Other Skills

- **scorecard**: Use `scorecard status` and `scorecard improve` for the scorecard gate (when configured)
- **crap**: Use the `crap` skill for detailed CRAP score analysis if available

## Generated Code Exclusions

Source-generated code (e.g. `[GeneratedRegex]` methods) is **excluded** from CRAP analysis.
These methods produce compiler-generated state machines with unreachable backtracking branches
that cannot be meaningfully refactored or branch-covered.

**Exclusion mechanisms (all must be applied together):**

1. **Coverage collection** — `coverage.runsettings` excludes:
   - Files matching `**/*.g.cs` or `**/GeneratedRegex*.cs`
   - Methods decorated with `GeneratedCodeAttribute` or `ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute`
   - Auto-property accessors (`SkipAutoProps`) — intentionally excluded as trivial code

2. **ReportGenerator CRAP report** — pass file filters:

   ```powershell
   reportgenerator -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:CoverageReport \
     -reporttypes:JsonSummary -filefilters:"-**/*.g.cs;-**/GeneratedRegex*.cs"
   ```

3. **Manual triage** — if a method with CRAP > 30 appears in the report and its
   class name contains `RegexRunner` or `GeneratedRegex`, or it resides in a `*.g.cs`
   file, it is source-generated and should be excluded from the CRAP gate count.

**Decision rationale** (GitHub Issue #36): Generated regex runners (`TryMatchAtCurrentPosition`,
CC ≈ 56) are produced by `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Generator`. Their complexity is
inherent to optimized regex compilation and is not a maintenance risk.

## Notes

- Coverage thresholds are enforced via coverlet.runsettings (configure when ready)
- The `coverage:ratchet` approach auto-tightens coverage thresholds over time
- Build warnings are treated as errors — fix root causes per AGENTS.md
- Always pass `--settings src/CodexBar.Core.Tests/coverage.runsettings` when collecting coverage
